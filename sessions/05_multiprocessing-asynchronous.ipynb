    "\n",
    "* **Multithreading**: There is one single process that can have several execution _threads_ at the same time. The (theoretical) advantage is that all these threads share the same memory and are lightweight.\n",
    "* **Multiprocessing**: Several processes are launched at the same time. The disadvantage is that they have more overhead and it's more difficult to share data between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems clear that multithreading would be the obvious choice, but in Python it's not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can broadly classify computer programs in two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CPU-bound**: The bottleneck is the CPU. The faster the CPU, the faster the program will complete. Basically any calculation the computer does with data that resides in RAM.\n",
    "* **I/O-bound**: The bottleneck is the input/output, either from disk, from the network, or any other sources. The faster the I/O, the faster the program will complete. This includes downloading data from the Internet, reading files from disk, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python canonical implementation (CPython, the one everybody uses) has a limitation called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which means that **only one thread can use the CPU at a time**. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, **multithreading should not be used in Python for CPU-bound code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this course, even though multithreading can be used in Python for I/O-bound code, we will skip it entirely, since it's also more complex to synchronize and can lead to subtle errors."
